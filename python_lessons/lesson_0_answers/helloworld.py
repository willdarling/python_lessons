# Hey Joey! Welcome to Python. This is a comment, and it's something we put in
# our code to give messages to any humans who might be reading our file.
# In python, comments start with the '#' sign

# The main has to be at the end of our file
def main():

# This is the main function. It tells the computer "start running the code from
